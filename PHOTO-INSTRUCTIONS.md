## Quick Instructions

To add your personal photo to the portfolio:

1. **Prepare your photo:**
   - Take a professional headshot photo
   - Crop it to a square (1:1 ratio)
   - Recommended size: 400x400 pixels minimum
   - Save as JPG or PNG format

2. **Add photo to project:**
   - Name your photo file: `abu-bakar-photo.jpg`
   - Place it in the `client/public/` folder
   - The path should be: `client/public/abu-bakar-photo.jpg`

3. **That's it!**
